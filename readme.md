# Kirby Plainkit

> Not so plain, really. This is a great place to start if you like Sass & CoffeeScript

## Setup

This project is based on Kirby CMS. Additional requirements include:

- PHP version 5.4 or newer
- [Node](https://nodejs.org) and NPM (Installed with [Brew](http://brew.sh), if possible)

To get started, use the GitHub application to clone the repository, or run:

```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/oof-bar/same-page.git
$ cd same-page
```

It's important that the `--recursive` flag is set, because we include a number of dependencies as submodules.

You'll need to create a few folders (if they don't exist, already) for things to work correctly:

```
$ mkdir app/site/accounts app/assets/avatars app/thumbs app/site/config
```

Then, fire up a PHP development server, on an available port:

```
$ php -S localhost:8000 -t app
```

The `-t` flag sets the web root to the `app` directory. We do this to protect leakage of source files and other configuration details into production environments. If you're using an Apache VirtualHost, make sure you use the `app` directory as your `DocumentRoot`!

Things will be pretty broken, right off the bat, but pulling down the `devDependencies` declared in `package.json` will get you most of the way there:

```
$ npm install
```

We use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) to consolidate the compilation of Sass and Coffeescript. Front-end Javascript is in the CommonJS architectre, and Browserify handles proper concatenation. Get going with a simple:

```
$ gulp watch
```

When you're ready to deploy, `$ gulp build` will generate minified versions of `app.css` and `app.js`. This is already set up as a local task for [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com), but you can run it manually, prior to using `rsync` or `scp`. Always remember to set up an ignore list before executing a command that overwrites remote files!

### Content

This is up to you! A basic content folder exists, and should be modified or trashed.

### Configuration

Add sensitive configuration to your environment-specific config file, as `site/config/config.localhost.php`, where `localhost` is the domain of the targeted environment. The standard `config.php` is tracked in the repository, by default, to store some environment-agnostic settings.

```php
c::set('custom.config.var', 'your-super-secret-key');
```
